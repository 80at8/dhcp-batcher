# dhcp-batcher
sonar dhcp-batcher/dhcp-relay written in go (not for production use, poc only!).

todo
- add router checks for batcher
- write tests for proxy code (thx 42wim! https://github.com/42wim/dhcprelay/)

break down a couple of large functions ~100 lines to smaller testable units.
convert structs to interface for better testing
